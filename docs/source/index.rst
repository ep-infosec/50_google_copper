Python Copper
=============

**Copper** is a module aimed at providing low-level hardware abstraction
layers (HAL) as Python modules. Copper aims to create a simple and well
designed API that will allow engineers with a diversity of skill sets and
skill levels to develop complex eletromechanical systems from common
off-the-shelf components.
